# Kombiz

This is a sample Rails, Angular, PostgreSQL and Bootstrap based fullstack app, that was created as a demosntration of the technologies used. To get this created, I've started reading [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@samgreen_22756/angular-8-with-rails-5-55cd186a02c9) to get this built, because other alternatives, like getting Angular served from `app/javascript`, didn't work so well for me.

## Setting up everything

### Angular

I started the project with the Angular app: `ng new kombiz`. In the interactive prompt, these are the options I've chosen:

```
Strict? no
Routing? yes
CSS? CSS
```

### Rails

Then, `cd kombiz/` and create the Rails app _in the same directory_: `rails new . -T --skip-turbolinks --webpack=angular`. Make sure to answer _n_ to all the overwrite questions.

#### Routing on Rails

Create a controller to handle all the routes

```
bundle exec rails g controller StaticController
```

And add this content

```
class StaticController < ApplicationController
  def index
    render file: Rails.root.join('public', 'index.html')
  end
end
```

So that Rails renders Angular's `index.html` file

Also, the routes file should look like this

```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Other routes before this
  get '*path', to: 'static#index'
end
```

Since this is a SPA, we're going to use [Angular Router](https://angular.io/api/router) to do the actual routing, so we only want Rails to serve a single route, the static one.

#### Getting everything running with Foreman

Add Foreman to the Gemfile

```
...
# Foreman to launch both Angular and Rails
gem 'foreman', '~> 0.87.2'
...
```

And run `bundle` to install the dependencies

Then, create a `Procfile` file, with this content

```
client: rm -rf public/* && ng build --watch=true
web: rails s -p 3000
```

At this point, you should have a running app ðŸŽ‰!

## Adding some content in the UI

Since `Kombiz` is a carpooling app, a `Driver` is an important entity, so let's get some drivers shown in our UI.

### Creating a component

Create a Component to display our `driver`s: `ng g c driver`
This will create all the needed files

```
CREATE src/app/driver/driver.component.css (0 bytes)
CREATE src/app/driver/driver.component.html (21 bytes)
CREATE src/app/driver/driver.component.spec.ts (626 bytes)
CREATE src/app/driver/driver.component.ts (275 bytes)
UPDATE src/app/app.module.ts (475 bytes)
```

#### Showing some data

Let's create some fake data for now, we'd like to get real drivers from the backend eventually. To do so, let's follow these steps:

1. Create a model class to represent the Driver:

```
mkdir -p src/app/model
cd app/javascript/coombie/src/app/model
touch src/app/model/Driver.ts
```

2. Create a service to hold hardcoded data (for now): `ng g s Data`

3. Add this content to the new service in: `src/app/data-service.ts`

```
import { Driver, DriverStatus } from './model/Driver';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Observable, of } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class DataService {
  drivers: Array<Driver>;

  getDrivers(): Observable<Array<Driver>> {
    return of(this.drivers);
  }

  constructor() {
    this.drivers = new Array<Driver>();

    const driver1 = new Driver();
    driver1.id = 1;
    driver1.alias = 'michael92';
    driver1.status = DriverStatus.DRIVING;
    this.drivers.push(driver1);

    const driver2 = new Driver();
    driver2.id = 2;
    driver2.alias = 'GiaCarDriver';
    driver2.status = DriverStatus.IDLE;
    this.drivers.push(driver2);

    const driver3 = new Driver();
    driver3.id = 3;
    driver3.alias = 'MarkZuckerberg';
    driver3.status = DriverStatus.DISABLED;
    this.drivers.push(driver3);
  }
}
```

4. Add contents to the HTML file in `src/app/driver/driver.component.html`

```
<h1>Drivers</h1>

<div>
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>ID</th>
        <th>Alias</th>
        <th>Status</th>
        <th></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr *ngFor = "let driver of drivers">
        <td>{{driver.id}}</td>
        <td>{{driver.alias}}</td>
        <td>{{driver.status}}</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
```

5. And to the TypeScript file in `src/app/driver/driver.component.ts`

```
import { DataService } from './../data.service';
import { Driver } from './../model/Driver';
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-driver',
  templateUrl: './driver.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./driver.component.css'],
})
export class DriverComponent implements OnInit {
  drivers: Array<Driver>;

  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.dataService.getDrivers().subscribe((next) => {
      this.drivers = next;
    });
  }
}
```

Then, get the JavaScript dependencies with: `npm i`

### Some errors

I got this error (on the Rails side)

```
18:51:53 web.1    | To disable this check, please change `check_yarn_integrity`
18:51:53 web.1    | to `false` in your webpacker config file (config/webpacker.yml).
```

So, I changed it to `false` in my `config/webpacker.yml` file.

Then, I got a `Template is missing`, which was solved by reinstalling the dependencies.

```
rm -rf node_modules/
npm i
```

### Fixing the routes

I had forgotten to add the proper routes, we only have one of them so far. Add this to the empty Array on `app-routing.module.ts`:

```
const routes: Routes = [{ path: `drivers`, component: DriverComponent }];
```

Also, make sure the only content on `app.component.html` is this:

```
<div class="container">
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</div>
```

## Adding Bootstrap

This looks horrible, so let's add Bootstrap: `npm install bootstrap`
and also add the styles to the `angular.json` file:

```
"styles": [
  "src/styles.css",
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
],
"scripts": ["node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"]
```

I'm not specifying any Bootstrap classes here, you should use the ones you prefer.

## Adding Font Awesome

I'm going to add Font Awesome now, so that we can use a few of its icons. To do so, install the free version: `npm install --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-free`

Add the CSS to the `angular.json` file, otherwise the icons won't be rendered:

```
"styles": [
  "src/styles.css",
  "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
  "node_modules/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all.css"
]
```

### Changes in the model

The model class now will look like this:

```
export class Driver {
  ...
  vehicleTypeEnum: typeof VehicleType = VehicleType; // Hacky way to use the enum on the component
}

...

export enum VehicleType {
  CAR = 'Car',
  VAN = 'Van',
  TRUCK = 'Truck',
}
```

Add the new field to the datasource, so we get all the possible vehicle types:

```
...
constructor() {
    this.drivers = new Array<Driver>();

    const driver1 = new Driver();
    driver1.id = 1;
    driver1.alias = 'michael92';
    driver1.status = DriverStatus.DRIVING;
    driver1.vehicleType = VehicleType.CAR;
    this.drivers.push(driver1);

    const driver2 = new Driver();
    driver2.id = 2;
    driver2.alias = 'GiaCarDriver';
    driver2.status = DriverStatus.IDLE;
    driver1.vehicleType = VehicleType.VAN;
    this.drivers.push(driver2);

    const driver3 = new Driver();
    driver3.id = 3;
    driver3.alias = 'MarkZuckerberg';
    driver3.status = DriverStatus.DISABLED;
    driver1.vehicleType = VehicleType.TRUCK;
    this.drivers.push(driver3);
  }
...
```

The `driver.component.html` will look like this now:

```
<table class="table table-striped table-hover">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>ID</th>
      <th>Alias</th>
      <th>Status</th>
      <th>Vehicle</th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr *ngFor = "let driver of drivers">
      <td>{{driver.id}}</td>
      <td>{{driver.alias}}</td>
      <td>{{driver.status}}</td>
      <td [ngSwitch]="driver.vehicleType">
        <i *ngSwitchCase="driver.vehicleTypeEnum.CAR" class="fa fa-car-side"></i>
        <i *ngSwitchCase="driver.vehicleTypeEnum.VAN" class="fa fa-shuttle-van"></i>
        <i *ngSwitchCase="driver.vehicleTypeEnum.TRUCK" class="fa fa-truck"></i>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

I've used a [ngSwitch](https://angular.io/api/common/NgSwitch) directive here, because I wasn't able to add the relevant classes dynamically using [ngClass](https://angular.io/api/common/NgClass). I don't know why, maybe the condition I wrote wasn't the correct one. Anyway, `ngIf` did the trick.

## Adding a 404 page

To add a default 404 page, so that we make sure that all possible routes are properly handled, let's create a new component

```
ng g c page-not-found
```

I found [this](https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/Qb71) really simple and cool template that uses Bootstrap, let's add it to our `page-not-found.component.html`, making some minor corrections

```
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
          <div class="error-template">
              <h1>
                  Oops!</h1>
              <h2>
                  404 Not Found</h2>
              <div class="error-details">
                  Sorry, this page is not available.
              </div>
              <div class="error-actions">
                  <a routerLink="/drivers" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-home"></span>
                      Take Me Home </a><a routerLink="/drivers" class="btn btn-default btn-lg"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span> Contact Support </a>
              </div>
          </div>
      </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Here, `routerLink="/drivers"` will redirect to our home component (we don't have a customer support component yet).  
We also need to add this to our routes on `app-routing.module.ts`:

```
import { PageNotFoundComponent } from './page-not-found/page-not-found.component';
import { DriverComponent } from './driver/driver.component';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: `drivers`, component: DriverComponent },
  { path: ``, component: DriverComponent }, // For now, this is our home
  { path: `404`, component: PageNotFoundComponent },
  { path: `**`, redirectTo: `/404` }, // Wildcard must be at the end, matches all
];
```

### Rails routing errors

If you see an error, where Rails is complaining about finding a template

```
Missing template Users/juanma/dev/fullstack/kombiz/public/index.html with {:locale=>[:en], :formats=>[:html], :variants=>[], :handlers=>[:raw, :erb, :html, :builder, :ruby, :jbuilder]}. Searched in: * "/Users/juanma/dev/fullstack/kombiz/app/views" * "/Users/juanma/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.7.0/gems/actiontext-6.0.3.4/app/views" * "/Users/juanma/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.7.0/gems/actionmailbox-6.0.3.4/app/views" * "/Users/juanma/dev/fullstack/kombiz" * "/"
```

You should wait for the full frontend (the `client` command) to finish building.

## Summary

I'm not a great fan of this Angular and Rails structure, for several reasons. For starters, it mixes up the folder structure of both frameworks, and it feels as if you're neglecting some of Rails' features (like the routing, for example).  
Anyway, it was a great starting point for a fullstack app, and it works propery.
